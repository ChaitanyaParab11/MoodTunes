#Project Title - MoodTunes

Designing a music recommendation system that incorporates emotion detection from facial expressions to personalize music recommendations for users.




#The problem MoodTunes solves

Mood-based Music Recommendation: The app can use facial recognition technology to detect the user's current mood, and then recommend music that aligns with that mood, such as happy or energetic music for a positive mood and relaxing or soothing music for a more relaxed or calm mood.

Personalized Playlists: Users can create custom playlists based on their emotional state. The app can analyze their facial expressions and select music that fits their current mood, allowing them to listen to music that they are most likely to enjoy.

Emotional Therapy: The app can be used as an emotional therapy tool, helping users to manage their emotions by listening to music that matches their current mood and state of mind.

Improved User Experience: The app can improve the user experience by providing personalized music recommendations based on their emotions, rather than relying on generic algorithms or playlists.

Better Understanding of Emotions: The app can help users gain a better understanding of their emotions by showing them which music aligns with their moods and how different types of music can affect their emotions.

Music Discovery: Users can discover new music that they may not have found otherwise, based on their emotional state. The app can recommend music that they might enjoy based on their current mood, which can lead to new musical discoveries and broaden their musical horizons.
